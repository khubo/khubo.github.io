  Developers love (talking about) open source. The popularity of GitHub, the infinite number of modules in package registries, and open source projects are all indicators of this. I, myself, have contributed and tried to contribute to open-source projects. I believe that's how the world is supposed to work. Humans should share knowledge and collectively build stuff, enabling each other.

  It seems developers aren't the only ones in love with Open source though. From baby startups to conglomerates, every other company is dying to show their love for OSS these days. Some of these are the same companies that have more patent lawyers than developers or have been busy bashing open source a while ago. I bet they didn't suddenly turn into socialists or something. I can think of two reasons. 


## Exploitation

   |  For most companies, open-source is free labor. Many of the most popular modules in almost all popular languages are being written and maintained by some developers in their free time. Companies that use them often save a lot of resources in terms of money, and time without ever giving back. And when they give back, it's often irrelevant compared to what they have saved from using them. This is despite the fact that some of these developers are actively looking for financial contributions. Not particularly interesting considering how most companies themselves are built by the very means of exploitation.


## Symbolic Capital
  
Symbolic Capital is a concept coined by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu.  Any abstract resources like honor, respect, and fame that can serve as a value that an entity can hold within a culture can be considered symbolic capital. Bourdieu argues that one kind of capital can be exchanged for another. Companies spending millions on ads to create identities like eco-friendly or ethical without spending a fraction of that on solving the actual problem is a good example of this. 

 Open-source is cool. Or rather it is considered cool, tech-savvy, morally good, etc; only for the virtue of being open. It is hard to define terms like "cool", "good",  "attractive" etc. Even though it's fine to argue that these things are subjective, or are individual perspectives they still are vastly influenced by the narratives that run through our society or culture - Just like how slavery or patriarchy was cool once! 

 Companies have been trying to forge these identities of being cool, tech-savvy, and morally good for themselves by engaging with open source in all sorts of ways. From internally promoting contributions to open source projects to funding conferences around these technologies, all avenues are explored.  And often more effort is put into convincing the world that they really love open-source by incessantly talking about it on social media, having their logos on sponsors' banners, etc. Slowly accumulating symbolic capital. This helps them with everything from marketing to acquiring new talent. Everyone loves working with/for the cool company!

  It might be a little better this way for many developers, but it doesn't make up for the fact that Open-source itself has become another avenue for further exploitation and manipulation. From being an end goal of being open, it has become a means to an end. And it's not cool. Open-source is not cool anymore.
